# Probe filtering (BLE Central selection)
# Precedence:
# 1) If PROBE_ADDRESS is set, the hub uses it.
# 2) Else, the hub falls back to PROBE_NAME.

# Option A (recommended on hardware day): filter by BLE address
# PROBE_ADDRESS=AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF

# Option B: filter by BLE name (v0 uses "PlantProbe")
# NOTE: On hardware day, uncomment PROBE_ADDRESS after discovering it in nRF Connect
PROBE_NAME=PlantProbe
