# Hub Logs

This folder contains **runtime log files** generated by the hub while it is running locally.

Log files are created automatically and are used for:
- Debugging hub behavior
- Inspecting BLE reads and HTTP posts
- Verifying polling cycles and errors

---

## Important notes

- This folder is created locally at runtime
- Log files are **not committed to version control**
- Contents may be deleted at any time without impact

If this folder is missing, it can be recreated with:

```bash
mkdir -p logs
```

## Relationship to the rest of the system
- Logs here reflect hub activity only.
- They do not include firmware logs or backend logs.
