# Diagrams

This folder contains **visual diagrams** that explain the architecture, data flow, and interactions within the Smart Plant Soil Moisture Monitoring System.

Diagrams are used to:
- Provide high-level understanding of the system
- Clarify relationships between hardware and software components
- Communicate design intent quickly without reading code

They are intended to complement written documentation, not replace it.

## What belongs in this folder

This folder may include:
- System architecture diagrams
- BLE communication flow diagrams
- Data flow diagrams (probe → hub → backend)
- Component interaction diagrams
- Sequence diagrams for key flows

Diagrams should focus on concepts and relationships, not implementation details.

---

## What does NOT belong here

- Source code
- Step-by-step setup instructions
- Experimental sketches or throwaway visuals
- UI mockups or design assets

Those belong elsewhere in the repository.

---

## How diagrams are used

Diagrams are typically referenced from:
- Product specifications
- System requirements
- Architecture decision records
- Runbooks when explaining complex flows

Each diagram should be understandable on its own or clearly referenced from another document.

---

## Naming and format guidelines

When adding diagrams:
- Use descriptive, human-readable file names
- Prefer formats that render well in GitHub (e.g. PNG, SVG, PDF)
- Include a short caption or explanation in the referencing document

If a diagram requires extensive explanation, consider pairing it with a short markdown file.

---

## Relationship to the rest of the documentation

- **Diagrams** → visual explanations
- **Specs** → written definitions and requirements
- **Decisions** → reasoning behind architectural choices
- **Runbooks** → operational instructions

Together, these provide both visual and textual understanding of the system.

---

## Future direction

This folder may expand to include:
- More detailed sequence diagrams
- Calibration or sensor behavior visuals
- Updated architecture diagrams as the system evolves

Diagrams should be updated when major architectural changes occur.
