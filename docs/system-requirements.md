## 1. Purpose

This document defines the functional and non-functional requirements for the **v0 local prototype** of the Smart Plant Soil Moisture Monitoring System.

The v0 scope includes:

- One plant

- One soil moisture probe

- One home hub

- One local backend running on a developer machine

- Optional mobile app consuming the same local APIs

Cloud infrastructure and remote push notifications are **explicitly out of scope** for this phase.

## 2. System Overview

The system consists of four subsystems:

1. Plant Probe Subsystem

1. Home Hub Subsystem

1. Local Backend Subsystem (running on a developer machine)

1. Mobile Application Subsystem (optional for early v0)

The system operates entirely on a **local network**.

Soil Sensor → BLE Probe → Raspberry Pi Hub → Local Backend → App / Alerts

```

## 3. Plant Probe Subsystem Requirements

### 3.1 Hardware Requirements

- The probe uses a capacitive soil moisture sensor.

- The probe uses Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for communication.

- The probe operates on battery power.

- The probe supports recharging without removing the battery.

- The probe remains small and non-bulky for placement in a plant pot.

**v0 hardware (locked):**

- Adafruit Feather nRF52840 Express

- Adafruit STEMMA I²C Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor

- 3.7V 1200mAh LiPo Battery

- Adafruit Micro-Lipo Charger

- STEMMA JST-PH cabling

### 3.2 Functional Requirements (Probe)

- The probe measures soil moisture using capacitive sensing.

- The probe reads sensor data via I²C.

- The probe wakes on a configurable schedule, with an initial default of every 3–6 hours.

- The probe transmits moisture readings wirelessly using BLE.

- The probe returns to deep sleep after completing each reading cycle.

### 3.3 Power and Battery Requirements

- The probe minimizes power usage through aggressive sleep cycles.

- The probe powers the soil sensor only during active measurements.

- The probe targets multi-week battery life under normal usage.

- The probe exposes battery charging status through firmware state or onboard indicators.

### 3.4 Data Requirements (Probe Output)

Each moisture reading includes:

- A unique probe identifier

- A timestamp (generated by the hub)

- A raw moisture value

Optional data supported in future versions includes:

- Battery level

- Signal strength (RSSI)

## 4. Home Hub Subsystem Requirements

### 4.1 Hardware Requirements

- The hub supports BLE scanning.

- The hub supports Wi-Fi connectivity.

- The hub operates continuously as an always-on device.

- The hub supports local processing and HTTP communication with a backend.

**v0 hardware (locked):**

- Raspberry Pi Zero W

- 32GB microSD card

- External 5V micro-USB power supply

### 4.2 Functional Requirements (Hub)

- The hub scans continuously for BLE broadcasts from probes.

- The hub identifies known probes using unique identifiers.

- The hub decodes moisture data received over BLE.

- The hub forwards moisture readings to a local backend over HTTP.

- The hub retries uploads when the backend is temporarily unavailable.

### 4.3 Reliability Requirements (Hub)

- The hub recovers automatically after power loss.

- The hub starts required services on boot without user intervention.

- The hub logs BLE scan events, uploads, and failures for debugging.

## 5. Local Backend Subsystem Requirements

### 5.1 Runtime and Deployment

- The backend runs locally on a developer machine.

- The backend listens on a configurable local network port.

- The backend does not require authentication for v0.

- The backend stores all data locally.

**Recommended stack (v0):**

- Node.js with Express

- SQLite for persistent storage

### 5.2 Functional Requirements (Backend)

- The backend accepts moisture readings from the hub via HTTP.

- The backend validates incoming payloads against a defined data contract.

- The backend stores moisture readings locally.

- The backend maintains the latest reading per probe and plant.

- The backend evaluates moisture readings against configured thresholds.

- The backend computes plant status (e.g., “OK”, “Needs Water”).

### 5.3 Alerting Requirements (Local)

- The backend triggers alerts when moisture crosses below configured thresholds.

- Alerts are generated only on threshold crossings, not repeated low readings.

- Alerts respect a configurable cooldown period.

- Alerts are delivered locally via:

	- Console logs

	- Optional desktop notifications

Push notifications and cloud messaging are not required for v0.

### 5.4 Data Model Requirements

The backend supports the following entities:

- Plants

- Probes

- Moisture readings

- Threshold configurations

- Alert events

## 6. Mobile Application Requirements (Optional for v0)

### 6.1 Platform Requirements

- The mobile app is built using React Native.

- The mobile app communicates with the local backend over HTTP.

- The mobile app operates on the same local network as the backend.

### 6.2 Functional Requirements (App)

- The app displays the current soil moisture level.

- The app displays the last updated timestamp.

- The app displays plant status (e.g., “OK”, “Needs Water”).

- The app allows users to configure moisture thresholds.

- The app reflects alert state generated by the backend.

## 7. Notifications and Alerts Requirements

- Alerts trigger when moisture crosses configured thresholds.

- Alerts do not require internet connectivity.

- Alerts are generated and consumed locally.

- The system limits alert frequency to prevent notification fatigue.

## 8. Security and Privacy Requirements (v0)

- BLE communication does not transmit personal user data.

- The local backend accepts requests only on the local network.

- No user authentication is required for v0.

- Personal data storage is minimal and local-only.

## 9. Scalability and Future Compatibility

The system design supports future expansion to:

- Cloud-based backends

- Remote access and push notifications

- Multiple probes per plant

- Multiple plants per user

- Multiple homes per account

The v0 local backend mirrors the API shape expected for future cloud deployment to minimize refactoring.

## 10. v0 Acceptance Criteria

The system is considered successful when:

- Soil moisture readings are captured accurately

- Probe-to-hub BLE communication is reliable

- The hub forwards readings to the local backend

- The backend stores and evaluates readings correctly

- Alerts trigger at the correct thresholds

- The system operates unattended on a local network for multiple days
